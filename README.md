You should provide a README file which documents the following:
    a description of your strategy for maintaining compaction (i.e. how are you preventing your heap from turning into a bunch of tiny free blocks?)
    your mm_realloc() implementation strategy, more specifically what optimizations or deliberate choices did you make to improve throughput and / or utilization
your strategy to achieve high throughput (see next point on Performance)
unresolved bugs with your program
any other optimizations
